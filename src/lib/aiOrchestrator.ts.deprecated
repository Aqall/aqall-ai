/**
 * @deprecated This file is deprecated. Use the new Lovable-style pipeline:
 * - plannerAgent.ts (Planner Agent)
 * - architectAgent.ts (Architect Agent)  
 * - coderAgent.ts (Coder Agent)
 * - workspaceService.ts (File tools)
 * 
 * The new pipeline provides:
 * - Better structure (Planner → Architect → Coder)
 * - File-based workspace system
 * - Real file tools (read/write/apply_patch)
 * - Industry-aware section generation
 * - Better quality components
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but should not be used in new code.
